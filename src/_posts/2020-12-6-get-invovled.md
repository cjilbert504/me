Being new to programming can make you feel like you are an outsider, alone and have a lot of ground to make up in order to even feel close to the level that others you encounter are at in their abilities.

I definitely felt this way and still somewhat do, however as time passed and I made acquaintances within the Ruby community, I found that really, no one really cares if you're new at programming. In fact, it seems to excite them. Perhaps they are transported back to that time when they first started and remember the simple joys of small victories and making progress which lead them to the path they are on now.

It is also very much worth mentioning that most people are also extremely willing to help you out or answer any questions that you may have about certain matters. But how does one even get to the point of feeling comfortable reaching out to someone who we may view as more senior/experienced than ourselves? Well, unfortunately, I personally don't know that one ever gets completely comfortable doing so and perhaps that shouldn't be the goal anyway. Sure some are better at this than others but in time, I feel, that if you reach out to people in a genuine fashion you will start to feel more at ease about it while making real connections.

So with all of that out of the way I would like to share the incredibly simple way that I approached trying to get involved more in the Ruby community.

The simple answer..... podcasts.

I found a few podcasts that I enjoyed listening to and would do so religiously. I started following the hosts on Twitter and such and would also do so with the guests that would be on the show. Now I must stress the point that I wasn't just following and listening because I was trying to "network". I truly enjoyed the host(s), the guest and the subject matter that was going on in these episodes. When they would post about the episode to Twitter I would listen and when I enjoyed the episode I would let them know. When there was a guest on who I thought did a great job and I enjoyed their conversation, I would reach out and let them know.

This lead me to get involved with some of the most amazing, helpful and nice people. I've gotten involved in multiple open source projects that I really feel strongly about and made some friends along the way. And that last statement I think is the main take away here. Make friends not "connections". Be genuine with what you do and say and you just may find yourself in a truly amazing place, doing some great work and doing it alongside some great people.
